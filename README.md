# pseudo-profound-bullshit-generator

This repository houses a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app that employs [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s GPT-3.5 model to generate pseudo-profound bullshit statements.

As an exercise, we instruct the AI to concoct seemingly deep and meaningful statements that are actually nonsensical or vacuous.
See Frankfurt's [_On Bullshit_](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691122946/on-bullshit) for more.

You can use the public application with your open OpenAI API key on [Streamlit Cloud](https://mr-devs-pseudo-profound-bullshit-generator-streamlit-app-yw2ecl.streamlit.app/).
